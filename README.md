# Purescript
PureScript is a general purpose language which compiles to JS. Unlike a domain-specific language like Elm (which is only for front-end apps) that pretty much means PureScript can in theory entirely replace JS for any purpose â€“ though you may find in practice that it is better for some applications than others, and you may end up calling out to some vanilla JS (e.g. common library bindings) out of expedience.

PureScript is extremely similar to Haskell, enough so that I find I can usually read PureScript just fine. Writing PureScript I often get tripped up due to a variety of small but important details, but if I sat down and properly learned the language, and/or wrote a few bona fide projects with it, I imagine those trip-ups would become rare.
